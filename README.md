## 💡 Why I Built This

As a student at Purvanchal University, I noticed that there wasn't a centralized platform for students to buy and sell items within our community. I wanted to create something that would make it easier for students to connect and trade, while also learning modern web development technologies.

This marketplace is built by students, for students. It's more than just a project – it's a tool to help our community thrive.
